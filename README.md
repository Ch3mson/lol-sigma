<h1>About</h1>

<p>lol-timeline is a League of Legends web app that analyzes a players past games and displays stats based on their information. With this information, it will give better insight on how you play throughout the day, and which matchups you are strongest and weakest against, and allow you to determine whether you should dodge games or not.</p>

<h1>Purpose</h1>

<p>This is an introductory project for me in learning how to make API calls using express, displaying them using React/Vite, and becoming better with TailwindCSS styling. Additionally, MongoDB will be used (eventually once i get there), to store user data, so players can constantly update their stats while they use the app, to avoid rate limits. As it is used more, players will have more up to date information on their user.</p>
